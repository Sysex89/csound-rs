## Installation

To build the Csound bindings or anything depending on this crate, you need to
have at least Csound 6.11, previous versions are not suported.
By default( The only supported way), this crate will attempt to dynamically link to the system-wide libcsound64.

<a name="installation-linux"/>

### Linux/BSDs

You can install Csound using your distro-package manager,
or in case your package manager has a unsupported version of Csound( <6.11 ) 
you have to build it from source.

On Debian/Ubuntu Csound can be installed with

```
# Make sure the version of this package is >= 6.11
$ apt-get install libcsound64-6.0 libcsound64-dev
```

Also, You can compile it from source and install(recommended)

```
# First, install all the csound's dependencies
$ apt-get install build-essential libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev cmake /
flex bison libsndfile1-dev libsndfile1
```
then, clone the csound's source code
```
# Clone Csound from its repository
$ git clone https://github.com/csound/csound.git
```
Compile and install the library.

```
# Clone Csound from its repository
$ cd csound/
$ cmake . && make && sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```
Csound will be installed in */usr/local/lib*, there is where the build.rs script will look at, for the csound's binaries.
so, It could be a good idea if you export this path in your bashrc or write a propper pkg-config file.

### macOS

`CsoundLib64.framework` is expected in `/Library/Frameworks/`. If it's installed
in a different path specify `CSOUND_LIB_DIR` for that.

<a name="installation-windows"/>

### Windows

Download the csound's installer for [*windows*](https://github.com/csound/csound/releases/download/6.12.2/Csound6.12.0-Windows_x64-installer.exe)
Follow the instalation steps. 
1. Locate your csound installation directory ( commonly it is *C:\\Program Files\\Csound6_x64*)
2. Open Command Prompt (make sure you Run as administrator so you're able to add a system environment variable).
3. Set the environment variable as follows:
```
$ setx CSOUND_LIB_DIR "C:\\Program Files\\Csound6_x64\\lib"
```
4. Restart Command Prompt to reload the environment variables then use the following command to check the it's been added correctly.
```
$ echo %CSOUND_LIB_DIR%
```
You should see the path to your Csound's lib installation.

## Getting Started

The API reference can be found
[here](https://csound.com/docs/api/index.html)

For getting started withCsound-rs, you have to understand some basic concepts about Csound, before to try to use this

## Csound's examples for rust
The easy way to get familiar with csound is to explore the examples. To get the examples we just need to clone this repository.
```
# Clone Csound from its repository
$ git clone https://github.com/neithanmo/csound-rs.git
```
Now, go to the repository directory
```
# Clone Csound from its repository
$ cd csound-rs
```
For running the examples 1 to 10 just:
```
# Runs the example 5
$ cargo run --release --example example5
```
The  example 11 requires some dependencies, but you can run them through calling cargo on their own Cargo.toml file
```
# Runs the example 11
$ cd examples/example11
$ cargo --release build
$ cargo run
```
